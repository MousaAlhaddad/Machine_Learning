# Machine Learning
To review the concepts of machine learning 

## Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Machine Learning: The algorithms of this type of machine learning learn from labeled data and, then, try to predict the labels (values) of new unlabeled data. Supervised learning is divided into two types: classification (for categorical outcomes) and regression (for numeric values).
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning: Unsupervised learning techniques learn from unlabeled data and can group together the items that are likely to be similar.
3. Reinforcement Machine Learning: This type has recently been gaining a lot of publicity, but still is limited in its uses.

## Deep learning
Deep learning is a supervised learning technique that is used heavily for image recognition among many other applications. Its predictions are highly accurate but mostly difficult to be explained. It needs a lot of data and a high computer performance capacity.
