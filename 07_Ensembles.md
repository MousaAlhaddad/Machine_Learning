# Ensembles
By combining algorithms, we can often build models that perform better by minimizing bias and variance. 

## Warnings 
1. The default for most ensemble methods is a decision tree in sklearn.
2. Linear models have low variance, but high bias. An example of an algorithm that tends to have high variance and low bias is a decision tree.
